Keystone is a crazy idea I have to create yet another requirements gathering and management tool. It's been done before. It's been done a million times before. This is just another go at the same old thing.

So, why do it? Because everything out there is built for the "enterprise" and, quite frankly, sucks. It's overly complicated. It requires a bazillion form fields to use and a PHD in computer science to understand. There's no easy "enter an idea" form that actually _encourages_ discussion. In my experience, requirements are less about "this shall that" and more about "what if we…" and "wouldn't it be cool if…." This project aims to encourage those discussions while providing a documented and traceable method to monitoring those ideas throughout the lifecycle of the project.

At a high level Keystone breaks down requirements into a "[syntactic hierarchy][syntactic-hierarchy]" that allows for general phrasing of a requirement to drill down to a deeper, more specific, requirement in time. The approach is similar to writing a paper by starting with your outline and then filling in the parts by replacing out items in the outline with paragraphs of prose. For example, if you were building an amusement park you may start with some requirements that dictate the "regions" of the park, say "Old West" and "Metropolitan." Then, within each region you may define the rides that appear in the region, say a roller coaster called "Stage Coach Racer" and a lazy river called "Gold Rush Whitewater." Each ride would then have requirements for the queue lines, the ride itself, the exit gift shop, etc…. The advantage to Keystone is that you can start general and drill down to the specifics as requirements take shape.

Search is a big piece of requirement gathering. It has to be to prevent duplicate requirements but also to identify related and dependant requirements. E.g., using our amusement park example we may have a requirement for "running water" that superceeds everything: the cafeteria, the lazy river, the fountains, etc…. Search, and the ability to associate and relate requirements makes this level of specificity possible.

It's not done yet. Honestly, it's not even started yet. This post is as far as I've gotten so far. I may not even get any further. This is a side project that I've enjoyed thinking about and wanted to start to write about. If I do any more work on it, I'll post it here.
